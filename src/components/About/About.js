        Access control systems are an important part of an overall security
        program that is designed to deter and reduce both criminal behavior and
        violations of an organization’s security policies. But it is important
        to remember that it is only a part. First, it is important to understand
        that access control is not an element of security; it is a concession
        that security programs make to daily operational necessities. Perfect
        security involves perfect access control. By that, I mean that in a
        perfect security environment, not one person can enter who is not
        absolutely known without question to be an ardent supporter of the
        security portion of the overall mission of the organization. In a real
        organization, this virtually never happens. Access control systems are
        an automated method to allow “presumed” friendlies to enter controlled,
        restricted, and secured areas of a facility with only minimal vetting at
        the access control portal. Indeed, access control portals are doorways
        through a security perimeter in which the entrants are “assumed” to be
        friendly, due to their status as an employee, contractor, or softly
        vetted visitor. Understanding this, a new light is shed on the role of
        access control systems. They are a vulnerability that exists right in
        the heart of the security system. As such, one can now understand why
        one must understand Risk, Managing Risk, and Types of Countermeasures to
        understand how to properly utilize access control systems. One must also
        completely understand access control system principles so as not to
        create unseen vulnerabilities in the heart of the Security Program.
